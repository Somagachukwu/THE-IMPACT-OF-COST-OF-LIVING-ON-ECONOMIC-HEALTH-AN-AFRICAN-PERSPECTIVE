# THE IMPACT OF COST OF LIVING ON ECONOMIC HEALTH:AN AFRICAN PERSPECTIVE

# INTRODUCTION
#### In recent years, the rising cost of living has become a pressing issue across the African continent, impacting millions of households and shaping the trajectory of economic development. This trend is characterized by a steady increase in the prices of essential goods and services such as food, energy, housing, healthcare, and education, which often outpaces wage growth. The phenomenon has far-reaching implications for both individual well-being and the broader economic health of African nations, where income inequality and high poverty rates already pose significant challenges.
#### Africa’s diverse economies — ranging from resource-dependent nations to burgeoning industrial hubs — face unique but interconnected challenges in managing the rising cost of living. Contributing factors include global inflationary pressures, currency depreciation, supply chain disruptions, and local economic policies. Additionally, external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, have exacerbated existing vulnerabilities by driving up energy and food prices. For example, many African countries rely heavily on imported food and fuel, making them particularly susceptible to global price surges.
#### The consequences of this trend extend beyond immediate financial strain for households. The rising cost of living undermines purchasing power, exacerbates income inequality, and increases the prevalence of poverty. Families often cut back on essential spending, such as education and healthcare, leading to long-term socio-economic repercussions. Furthermore, businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), face declining consumer demand, higher operational costs, and reduced profit margins, which stifle economic growth and job creation.
#### Governments across the continent are grappling with the dual challenge of addressing these rising costs while fostering sustainable economic growth. Policymakers are tasked with implementing measures such as subsidies, tax relief, and wage adjustments to provide immediate relief, while also pursuing structural reforms to enhance productivity and resilience. However, limited fiscal space, high public debt levels, and governance issues complicate the implementation of such interventions.
#### The rising cost of living also has political and social dimensions. Protests and civil unrest in response to economic hardship have become increasingly common in many African countries, highlighting the urgency of addressing this issue. These disturbances disrupt economic activities and signal a growing demand for more inclusive and equitable policies.
#### This analysis aims to explore how increasing living expenses impact economic stability and growth, with a focus on key areas such as consumer behavior, inflation, employment, and poverty.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE ANALYSIS
1. Analyse the Relationship Between Rising Costs of Living and Inflation.

2. Assess the impact of inflation on purchasing power and economic stability.
3. Investigate the Impact on Business Operations and Investment Decisions.
4. Provide Policy Recommendations for Mitigating the Effects.

## DATA COLLECTION
#### The data was provided by Amdor Analytics and were also obtained from different sources like Kaggle, World bank, and Numbeo.

## ABOUT THE DATASET
#### The datasets were contained in four Excel workbooks providing information on GDP, cost of living, inflation rate, and minimum wages of different countries yearly.

## METHODOLOGY

## DATA MANIPULATION
### Power Query was used in the cleaning and manipulation of this dataset.
### The dataset was cleared of blanks. Columns with numbers with empty cells were filled with the average of that column, and category columns with empty cells were filled with N/A. The country was filtered down to thirteen African countries and the year filtered to 2017–2023.

## CREATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TABLES
#### With the dataset cleaned and ready to be analysed, a many-to-one relationship was created across all tables to ease analysis.

## ANALYSIS
## CREATING A DASHBOARD
#### While this analysis is more of a report presentation than a visualization presentation, a one page dashboard was still created to show the summary of the key metrics which includes:
* Country: The number of countries analysed.
* Yearly GDP by Country: This shows the annual trend analysis of gross domestic product by country.
* Cost of living Index by Country: Shows the percentage cost of living for different countries
* Inflation Rate by country: This shows the inflation rate annually for different countries.
* Local Purchasing Power Index by Inflation Rates of Countries: This shows the percentage of local purchasing power and inflation rates of different countries.

## Observations
1. Cameroon and Zimbabwe have the highest cost of living index and Libya with the least.
2. Annually Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate, followed by Ghana, and Nigeria while Tanzania had the lowest inflation rate across all years.
3. Libya had the highest local purchasing power rate index recording 102.8% as against an inflation rate of 15.6% which suggests a nominal improvement in the cost of living.
4. Nigeria recorded the highest GDP across all years.
5. Ghana recorded the highest groceries index.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
#### 1. Recommendations for Policymakers

a. Immediate Relief Measures
* Subsidies for Essential Goods and Services:
* Provide targeted subsidies for food, energy, and transportation to alleviate the burden on low- and middle-income households.
* Implement temporary price controls or VAT reductions on essential items.
* Adjust Minimum Wages:
Regularly review and adjust minimum wages to align with inflation and cost-of-living indices, ensuring workers’ incomes keep pace with rising prices.
Social Safety Nets:
Expand direct cash transfers, food assistance programs, and unemployment benefits to vulnerable populations.

b. Medium- to Long-term Economic Stability

* Monetary Policy Interventions:

Tighten monetary policy to curb inflation by managing interest rates and reducing money supply, while balancing economic growth.

Strengthen currency stability through foreign exchange market interventions, if necessary.

* Support for Local Production:

Invest in agriculture and manufacturing to reduce dependence on imports and stabilize prices for key goods.

Provide incentives for smallholder farmers and local industries to boost productivity.

* Infrastructure Investment:

Develop infrastructure to improve supply chains, reduce transportation costs, and enhance market efficiency.

c. Tax and Fiscal Policies

* Progressive Taxation:

Implement progressive taxation to ensure wealthier segments contribute more toward fiscal revenue, which can fund social programs.

* Tax Relief for Low-income Earners:

Offer tax credits or exemptions for lower-income groups to increase disposable income.

* Debt Management:

Reassess national debt policies to ensure fiscal space for implementing social protection and economic recovery programs.

#### 2. Recommendations for Businesses

a. Pricing Strategies

* Transparent Pricing:

Ensure transparency in pricing to build consumer trust and prevent opportunistic price hikes during inflationary periods.

Innovative Packaging:

Offer smaller or alternative product sizes to accommodate consumers with lower purchasing power.

b. Support for Employees

* Fair Wages and Benefits:

Regularly adjust wages to reflect the rising cost of living, especially for low-income workers.

Non-monetary Benefits:

Provide support such as transportation allowances, healthcare benefits, or meal programs to offset rising expenses for employees.

c. Partnerships with Governments and NGOs
